    "Mutation in NEAT can change both connection weights and network structures.\n",

    "Through mutation, the genomes in NEAT will gradually get larger. Genomes of\n",
    "varying sizes will result, sometimes with different connections at the same positions.\n",
    "The most complex form of the competing conventions problem, with numerous differing topologies and weight combinations, is an inevitable result of allowing genomes to\n",
    "grow unbounded. How can NE cross over differently sized genomes in a sensible way?\n",
    "The next section explains how NEAT addresses this problem."
